I am a master's student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am honored to conduct research under the guidance of [Prof. Chao Li](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html). I am currently interning at Cloud Storage Innovation Lab, Huawei Cloud. I received my **Bachelor**'s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2022. My research interests lie in memory systems, disaggregated memory, systems for machine learning, and agent systems. 

I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs to further my research in these areas.

I’m not just a programmer; I’m also a hiker. Maybe we could explore the trails together.
