I am an incoming PhD student at the University of Toronto, where I will be working with [Prof. Qizhen Zhang](https://qizhenzhang.me/). I received my **Bachelor's** degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2022, followed by my **Master's** degree in Computer Technology from the same institution in 2025, under the guidance of [Prof. Chao Li](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html) and [Dr. Jing Wang](https://wjing6.github.io/index.html).

My research interests include distributed systems, networking, disaggregated memory, and systems for machine learning. Currently, my work focuses on developing efficient systems for large-scale data processing.

Beyond academia, I enjoy hiking and exploring nature trails. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss research or share hiking recommendations!
